# 🐾 Basic Machine Learning Project – Decision Tree on Zoo Dataset

## 🎯 Objective

This project introduces the fundamental steps in a machine learning workflow using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The key goals are:

- To understand and implement the basic stages of an ML project.
- To build, train, and evaluate a decision tree model.
- To visualize the trained model using Python libraries.
